          <section class="content"><p>Last week I went to Austin, <span class="caps">TX</span> to Scipy2016. I wasn’t sure what to expect. How would people communicate?
Would I fit in, what talks would interest me? Fortunately the conference was a huge success.
I have came away a far more confident and motivated programmer than when I went&nbsp;in.</p>

<h2 id="so-what-were-the-highlights-of-my-experience-at-scipy-">So what were the highlights of my experience at&nbsp;Scipy?</h2>
<p>On a personal level, I got to meet some of my coworkers, the members of the
Beckstein Lab. Dr. Oliver Beckstein, David Dotson, and Sean Seyler are brilliant
physicists and programmers who I have been working with on <a href="/articles/scipy2016/www.mdanalysis.org">MDAnalysis</a>
and <a href="/articles/scipy2016/www.datreant.org">datreant</a>. It was surreal to meet the people you have been
working with over the internet for 3 months and get an idea of how they
communicate and what they enjoy outside of work. It was the modern day
equivalent of meeting penpals for the first time. I especially appreciated
that David Dotson and Sean Seyler, both approximately four years my senior, provided
invaluable advice to a recent graduate. (If you’re reading this, thanks&nbsp;guys).</p>
<p>The most valuable moments were the conversations I had in informal settings.
There is a huge diversity in career trajectories among those attending Scipy,
everyone has career advice and technical knowledge to impart upon a young
graduate as long as you are willing to ask. I had excellent conversations with
people from <a href="/articles/scipy2016/cloverhealth.com">Clover Health</a>, Apple data scientists, Andreas
Klockner (Keynote Speaker), Brian Van de Ven (Bokeh Dev), Ana Ruvalcaba at
<a href="/articles/scipy2016/jupyter.org">Jupyter</a>, the list goes&nbsp;on…</p>
<h2 id="fascinating-troubling-and-unexpected-insights">Fascinating, Troubling, and Unexpected&nbsp;Insights</h2>
<ul>
<li>Scipy doubled in size in the last&nbsp;year!</li>
<li>So many free shirts (and stickers), don’t even bother coming with more than one shirt,
also nobody wears professional&nbsp;attire.</li>
<li>Overheard some troubling comments made by men at Scipy, e.g.
“Well, all the women are getting the jobs I’m applying for…”
(said in a hallway group, this is not appropriate even if it was a&nbsp;joke)</li>
<li>The amount of beer involved in social events is kind of nuts;
this probably comes with the territory of professional&nbsp;programming.</li>
<li>There are a lot of apologists for rude people, someone can be extremely
nonverbally dismissive and when you bring it up to other
people they will defend him (yes, always him) saying something to the effect of
‘he has been really busy recently’. Oliver Beckstein is a shining example of
someone who is very busy and makes a conscious effort to always be thoughtful
and&nbsp;kind.</li>
<li>Open source does not always imply open contribution, some companies represented at
Scipy maintain open source projects while making the barriers to contribution prohibitively&nbsp;high.</li>
<li>A lot of people at Scipy apologize for their job (half-seriously) if they aren’t
someone super-special like a matplotlib core developer or the inventor of Python.
Your jobs are awesome&nbsp;people!</li>
<li>It is <em>really</em> hot in&nbsp;Austin.</li>
<li><code>git pull</code> is just <code>git fetch</code> + <code>git merge</code>.</li>
<li>A lot of women in computing have joined and left male dominated organizations
not because people are necessarily mean, but because they’ve been asked out
too much or harassed in a similar fashion. Stay professional&nbsp;folks.</li>
<li>Cows turn inedible corn into edible&nbsp;steak.</li>
<li>As a young professional you have to work harder and take every moment more seriously than those older than you
in order to get&nbsp;ahead.</li>
<li>Breakfast tacos are&nbsp;delicious.</li>
<li>Being able to get out of your comfort zone is a professional&nbsp;asset.</li>
<li>Slow down, take a breath, read things over, don’t make simple&nbsp;mistakes.</li>
</ul>
