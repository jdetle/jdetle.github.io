Hello! This is my first post moving over to a new site built by
[wintersmith](https://github.com/jnordberg/wintersmith). Originally I was going
to use jekyll pages, but there was an issue with the latest ruby version not being
available for Linux, (maybe macs are better...). I spent *way too much* time
figuring out how to install a markdown plugin that allowed for the inclusion of
Latex. I did this all without realizing I could simply include:
```
<script type="text/javascript" async
  src="https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-MML-AM_CHTML">
</script>
```
below my article title and latex would easily render. Now that this roadblock is
cleared, I have no excuses preventing me from writing a post about my work.
