Superscripts: a^bc^d a^*hello*^.

Subscripts: H~2~O, H~23~O.

These should not be superscripts or subscripts, because of the unescaped spaces: a^b c^d, a~b c~d.

Latex math:

$2+2=4$

$x \in y$

$\alpha \wedge \omega$

$223$

Here’s some display math:

$$\frac{d}{dx}f(x)=\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}$$

These shouldn’t be math:

$p$-Tree

Here’s one that has a line break in it: $\alpha + \omega \times x^2$.

To get the famous equation, write `$e = mc^2$`.

$22,000 is a *lot* of money. So is $34,000. (It worked if “lot” is emphasized.)

Shoes ($20) and socks ($5).

Escaped `$`: $73 *this should be emphasized* 23$.
