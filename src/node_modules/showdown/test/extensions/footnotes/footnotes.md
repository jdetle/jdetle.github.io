Here is a footnote reference,[^1] and another.[^2] This should *not* be a footnote reference, because it contains a space.[^my note] Here is an inline note.[^3] You can also put the note text right in the footnote.^[like this]

1.  And in list items.[^5]

This paragraph should not be part of the note, as it is not indented.

[^2]: Hereâ€™s another note. Although footnote #2, it's actually first in the list of notes in
      markdown. The `footnotes` extension fixes the order automatically.

[^1]: Here is the footnote. It can go anywhere after the footnote reference. It need not be placed 
      at the end of the document.

[^3]: This is *easier* to type. Inline notes may contain [links](http://google.com) and `]`
verbatim characters, as well as [bracketed text].

[^4]: In quote.

[^5]: In list.
