My name is John Joseph Patrick Detlefs and I am a professional programmer.
This blog was initially started as a job requirement for the [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/).
<p>


I have since discovered that maintaining a blog is a good exercise in learning things
on my own, as well as discovering tools in the web development ecosystem. As of
right now I work for <a href='mdanalysis.org'>MDAnalysis</a> writing dimension
reduction algorithms.
