I had an idea for something I'd like to make/ see made.

_Problem it tries to solve_: Too many communication / data-provision platforms.

_How it solves it_: Allow easy curation and inspection of the communication that 
drives a project forward.

There are too many forms of communication, with not enough effective communication
aggregators. People who create things communicate on online hosting services like
Github, Microblogging services like twitter, email, chatting services like Gitter
and Slack, video chat, the list goes on. Aggregating this data in a digestible manner
is valuable to anyone interested in the history of how decisions were made and
projects were created.

Parties that this could be useful to:
------
+ developers looking to document the history of a company's various projects
+ lawyers looking to accumulate the data associated with discovery
+ academics keeping track of research
+ law enforcement tracking evidence

My idea is that a web app integrates with the browser such that one can easily aggregate
the data on these various sites by associating these events with a tag in time
and a stream it should be associated with.

If you cant read the picture, the idea is that all of these events are listed
on the stream a user or set of users decided to associate it with. We can have
templates for what users should use streams for, maybe a startup would have a
main stream for mobile, web, and desktop app development, but the idea is
extensible elsewhere.

Clicking on one of these points shows a component that curates the communication
for easy inspection. If a user would want to add a slack conversation, hopefully
we could get slack to support an api for creating a tag for that users personal interaction
with slack, and be able to clip and save it to that point in the stream. The
same interaction would happen with twitter, academic papers, saved emails, or
any other form of viewable data.

Of course maybe this already exists, or at least in some version with Evernote,
but the difference is in the accessibility of the experience, and tools to prevent
cluttering of data at a zoomed out inspection of the streams.
