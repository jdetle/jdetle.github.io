<p>It occurs to me in my previous post I didn’t thoroughly explain the motivation
for dimension reduction in general. When we have this data matrix $X$ with $n$
samples and each sample having $m$ features, this number m can be very large.
This data contains information that we want to extract, in the case of molecular
dynamics simulations these are parameters describing how the dynamics are occurring.
But this data can be features that distinguish faces from others in the dataset,
handwritten letters and numbers from other numbers, etc. As it is so eloquently put
by <a href="http://dip.sun.ac.za/~herbst/research/publications/diff_maps_prasa2008.pdf">Porte and Herbst at&nbsp;Arizona</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The breakdown of common similarity measures hampers
the efficient organisation of data, which, in turn, has
serious implications in the field of pattern recognition.
For example, consider a collection of n × m images,
each encoding a digit between 0 and 9. Furthermore, the
images differ in their orientation, as shown in Fig.1. A
human, faced with the task of organising such images,
would likely first notice the different digits, and thereafter
that they are oriented. The observer intuitively attaches
greater value to parameters that encode larger variances in the observations,
and therefore clusters the data in 10 groups, one for each&nbsp;digit</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here we’ve been introduced to the idea of pattern recognition and ‘clustering’,
the latter will be discussed in some detail later. Continuing&nbsp;on…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On the other hand, a computer sees each image as a
data point in $R^{nm}$, an nm-dimensional coordinate space.
The data points are, by nature, organised according to
their position in the coordinate space, where the most
common similarity measure is the Euclidean&nbsp;distance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The idea of the data being in a $nm$ dimensional space is introduced by the
authors. The important part is that a computer has no knowledge of the the patterns
inside this data. The human brain is excellent at plenty of algorithms, but dimension
reduction is one it is especially good&nbsp;at.</p>

<p>Hello! This is my first post moving over to a new site built by
<a href="https://github.com/jnordberg/wintersmith">wintersmith</a>. Originally I was going
to use jekyll pages, but there was an issue with the latest Ruby version not being
available for Linux, (maybe macs are better…). I spent <em>way too much</em> time
figuring out how to install a markdown plugin that allowed for the inclusion of
LaTex. I did this all without realizing I could simply&nbsp;include:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; async
  src=&quot;https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-MML-AM_CHTML&quot;&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre><p>below my article title and LaTex would easily render. Now that this roadblock is
cleared, I have no excuses preventing me from writing a post about my&nbsp;work.  </p>
