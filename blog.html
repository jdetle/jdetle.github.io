        <p class="blog-post-meta">May 19</p>
        <p> Bear with me, this title is not as pretentious as it might seem.
            This title is meant to have a double-meaning; not only is it a reference
            to the fact that this 'community-bonding' period is <em>FLYING</em>
            away, but also has to do with my actual <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5875821348651008">
            Summer of Code</a> project with <a href="http://www.mdanalysis.org/blog/">MDAnalysis</a>.
        </p>
        <p> The main goal of my work this summer will be to implement Principle
            Component Analysis and Diffusion Maps such that they are fast, but more
            importantly keep memory costs at a minimum. These are both <i>Dimension
            Reduction</i> techniques, and in the case of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_dynamics">
            Molecular Dynamics</a> (MD) simulation, the high-dimensional
            space being reduced is a 'trajectory' of atoms reflecting what is essentially a matrix
            in which the i<sub>th</sub> entry in a row (or column, this doesn't matter)
            reflect the xyz coordinates at the j<sub>th</sub> timestep in a simulation.
        </p>
        <p> In a MD trajectory, time flies on while the patterns of movement are left unrecorded
            in the raw data. The only limitation to the number of frames in a trajectory is access
            to computing power, this means there can be a tremendous amount of
            data to sort through. To my knowledge, the
            biggest things being studied currently are on the scale of the
            <a href='http://www.bio-itworld.com/2013/5/29/researchers-characterize-chemical-structure-hiv-capsid.html'>
            HIV-1 capsid</a>, which has 64 million atoms. Ignoring this size limitation,
            let's imagine that you're watching a tree branch swaying while you should
            be doing something far more important. Archimedes is
            quoted as saying, "Give me a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which
            to place it, and I shall move the world." Well, give me a big enough
            set of atoms and a powerful computer on which
            to run the simulation, and I can simulate that tree moving. Go ahead,
            you can quote me.
        </p>
        <p> While viewing the tree branch, your brain is processing that information. It is interpreting visual
            data that is changing with respect to time and trying to find patterns
            in that timeseries. It is, in essence, reducing the dimensionality of
            that very large data set and recording that swaying motion of the tree.
            The role of a dimension reduction algorithm on the aforementioned
            simulation is to find a similar pattern as best it can. This same idea can be used
            for facial recognition (which leads to the <em>awesome</em> term,
            <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenface'>Eigenfaces</a>)
            and many other problems. I'm a little worried that I'm being too much
            of an armchair scientist in saying this, but from what I can tell,
            the human brain is the best
            <a href='http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/06/bad-news-computers-are-getting-better-than-we-are-at-facial-recognition/372377/'>all-purpose</a>
            dimension reducer (according to my brain).
        </p>
        <p> Hopefully those attempts at metaphor weren't entirely god-awful.
            These are the ideas I am implementing and of course I have zero
            part in coming up with them. I will be drawing from work that other
            people have done for the most part, my intellectual effort will be
            spent mostly on ensuring things run as they should and that they run quickly.
        </p>
        <p> I officially start work on Monday and over this week I have been working
            to finish my senior thesis before the start date. I have also been working
            on a small refactor of an analysis module in MDAnalysis which of course
            took longer than I expected, but it is almost over with. I try to understand
            everything I'm looking at when looking at new code, and some times it
            can be somewhat of a hindrance. I like to follow the advice of smarter
            people than me, in this instance <a href='http://jvns.ca/'>Julia Evans</a>,
            and err on the side of thorough understanding. With that being said,
            a major goal and source of stress of mine is productivity.
            Eventually I'd like to write something on what I do to encourage productivity
            in the face of a mostly self-directed work environment.
        </p>

            In other news, I've been learning some wonderfully interesting things
            about <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_group'> Free Groups </a>
            as they pertain to <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homotopy'>homotopy theory</a>
            in my Topology class
            at Cal Poly, I am loving <i>East of Eden</i> by John Steinbeck, (which happens
            to be set right nextdoor to where I live), and I am doing a good job
            at maintaining my exercise regime. I hope to get alot of work done
            this weekend in preparation for my first day of work next week!

        <h2 class="blog-post-title">Introduction!</h2>
        <p class="blog-post-meta">May 11</p>

        <p>Hello world! I recently was given the amazing opportunity
            to contribute to MDAnalysis, an open source Molecular Dynamics simulation
            Analysis project through the Google Summer of Code initiative. I've
            been encouraged to maintain a blog by those giving me this opportunity
            so I'll start things off by explaining how I got this great summer job.
        </p>
        <p>To summarize it quickly, Google sponsors a program in which college
            students apply to work on projects for open source software organizations.
            I was very lucky to have my research advisor, Dr. Ashley Ringer
            McDonald, encourage me to apply. I satisfied the first application requirement
            by learning how to use git and closing an issue on the <a href="https://github.com/MDAnalysis/mdanalysis/issues">MDAnalysis Github page</a>.
            After that, I spent about 40 hours of concentrated effort over spring break
            studying dimensionality reduction and molecular dynamics in order to write a coherent
            application. By turning in a rough draft early I ensured the process was iterative; the contributors to
            MDAnalysis were very helpful with their critiques of my application.
        </p>
        <p> After turning in my final application, the process didn't really stop. I made
            sure to keep making pull requests and to learn more about development workflow. I have
            learned <strong>so</strong> much about workflow and how to get over
            the dread of starting a pull request in the past few months.
        </p>
        <p> And then I got the news! I had been accepted to the Google Summer of Code!
            I was and still am extremely excited. With that being said, success
            made me lazy and somewhat complacent. Recently, I have been doing the
            bare minimum in terms of work and that is about to change. Even if
            no one is reading this, consider this blog as the first step in accountability
            for the rest of the summer. I will be using this to keep a record of everything I
            am working on day to day.
        </p>
        <p> With the exception of this introduction post, every post will attempt to
            keep a focus on a particular issue. I might write a post about a
            topic related to my Summer of Code work, or something related to
            my many other interests. I endeavor to remain positive and
            thoughtful, I will work on my clear overuse of commas, and I will
            try to make my readers laugh.
        </p>
        <p> I look forward to keeping this up! JD out. </p>
