                                    starting computational research and development
                                </h2>
        <p class="blog-post-meta">June 9, 2016</p>
        <p> This is my first post about actual programming! When I started doing
            computational research about three years ago, I was lazy and borderline
            incompetent. Today, the tools I have learned allow me to be equally
            lazy while being somewhat more competent. These range from simple
            lifestyle decisions to basic tech skills.

        <h2> Tip 1: Install Linux </h2><link href="style/bg.css" rel="stylesheet">
        <p><a href='https://www.linuxmint.com/download.php'>
            <img src='images/justdoit.gif' ></a>
            Do yourself a favor and install
            Linux. My first install of Linux was done on my laptop, and it turns
            out that the wifi was broken until I installed the new drivers. Figuring
            out why things broke was a bit of a slog, but I eventually
            stumbled upon a great demonstration of the beauty of open source software.
            Incredibly, this <a href='https://github.com/lwfinger/'>
            Realtek employee</a> wrote drivers for Linux on his own time! <a href=
            'http://askubuntu.com/questions/318608/lenovo-yoga-13-realtek-wireless-driver/358479#358479'>
            Installing</a> these drivers was a bit of a rabbit's hole, but I firmly
            believe that system administration builds character. Also, for what
            its worth the install on my desktop was painless. <br>
            </p>
        <h2><br> Tip 2: After installing linux, learn your shell commands </h2>
            <h3> Navigating the command line</h3>
            <pre><code>
                pwd # shows where you are in the filesystem
                cd # changes directory to specfied path
                ls # shows existing files in path
                cp # copy specified file to new filename
                grep # a tool to search for regular expressions or patterns in
                # files/directories
                mkdir # creates a directory with a specified name in current path
                chmod # changes permissions for a file
                sudo # if given administrator priveleges, this allows installation
                # directories if given as a prefix to a shell command
                rm # deletes stuff

            </code></pre>
            <p> Internalizing the numerous tools at ones disposal takes some time.
                Part of me thinks that I have learned command line tools simply
                because it makes me feel like Deckard. <br>
                <div id='images'>
                <img src=images/enhance.gif></p>
                </div>
            <p> The workflow speed up can be tremendously useful. When it
                comes to tools like git, the Github Graphic User Interfaces (GUIs)
                available to Windows are *awful*
                in comparison and it becomes a necessity. <br><br>

            <h3>How I copied these downloaded gifs to my website directory</h3>
            <pre><code>
                # after downloading some files, open terminal.
                # change to website directory
                # for me this is:
                cd github/jdetle.github.io
                pwd # press enter
                # i am in /home/jdetlefs/github/jdetle.github.io
                # trying to copy to /home/jdetlefs/github/jdetle.github.io/images
                # the filename was some arbitrary string 'YUjaCfF' in Downloads
                # when typing a path '~' is a placeholder for '/home/username'
                cp ~/Downloads/YU # (press tab in terminal to autocomplete to filename
                # YU is a unique identifier for this file, pressing tab twice will list
                # all files with these characters as an identifier (DONT PRESS
                # ENTER YET)
                (continued) images/'filename'.gif # press enter
                # check that it exists in the appropriate path
                ls images
                # 'filename.gif' should exist in this path!
            </code></pre>
            <p> Initially this process may take longer than dragging and dropping
                files, but it quickly becomes far faster than using a GUI. </p>
            <h3> How I add a newly installed program to my $PATH</h3>
            <pre><code>
                echo $path
                export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/my/program
                echo $PATH
            </code></pre>
            <h3> How I work in virtualenvs (kind of complicated) </h3>
            <p> First, upgrade the things! </p>
            <pre><code>
                sudo apt-get upgrade
            </pre></code>
                From here, things can get complicated if you have an installation
                of <a href='https://www.continuum.io/downloads'>Anaconda.</a>
                Both <a href='https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip'>pip</a>
                and anaconda are package managers, and but when installing itself,
                anaconda installs pip in its own directory, and handles virtual
                environments on its own. Things can break when using both conda and
                pip because managing dependencies is ugly and awful and left for
                people with higher pain tolerances than me. Of course, one can
                use conda virtualenvs, the differences probably aren't too significant.
                This is actually still a problem on my laptop, so I am going to
                spend this time installing pip without conda and getting virtualenvs
                to work on my laptop! (<a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdZQL04sDBU'>6 and a half hours later.</a>)

                ... Okay so this isn't pretty. If anaconda3 is installed, it looks like
                virtualenvwrappers won't work because virtualenvwrapper only
                works using python2.7? (Don't hold me to this). My solution was
                to delete anaconda3 altogether. Often times I've learned that
                the brute force solution works pretty well. (Somewhere in the
                distance <a href=https://twitter.com/pwang> Peter Wang </a>
                feels a disturbance in the force.)
            <pre><code>
                rm -rf anaconda3 # CAREFUL
            </pre></code>
                <em> Be careful with this!!!</em> It recursively deletes this
                directory and all files in it and can royally ruin your computer.
            <pre><code>
                sudo apt-get install python-pip python-dev python-cython python-numpy g++
                sudo pip install --upgrade pip
                sudo pip install virtualenvwrapper
                vi ~/.bashrc
            </pre></code>
                <p> Crap! Another thing I have to explain! vi opens Vim, a text editor
                    that keeps things fast and simple. A fresh installation of
                    Ubuntu 14.04 will come with Vi Improved or vim, that is a
                    superset of a vi (a relic of days of yore) but has no preinstalled functionality. To
                    install a working version of Vim that allows for syntax highlighting
                    and easy workflow tools, do the following.
            <pre><code>
                sudo apt-get update # cant hurt
                sudo apt-get install vim
                # ctrl-shift-n to open a new terminal window
                # vi ~/.vimrc
                # (press shift+colon) i (press enter) will allow you to start inserting
                # copy and paste this  with a mouse
                set expandtab
                set tabstop=4
                set softtabstop=4
                set shiftwidth=3
                set autoindent
                set textwidth=80
                set nocompatible
                set backspace=2
                set smartindent
                set number
                set cindent
                colo torte # preinstalled color schemes in /usr/share/vim/vim74/colors
                syntax on
                # (press shift+colon) wq (press enter) to write and quit
                # x does wq simultaneously
            </pre></code>
            <p> Here is some more info on <a href='http://bullium.com/support/vim.html'>Vim</a>
                Let's get back to editing our bash shell configuration file (~/.bashrc)
            <pre><code>
                vi ~/.bashrc
                # before doing anything add the path
                # (shift+colon) i (enter) and line 1 should be
                PATH=~/bin:$PATH
                # line 2
                export PATH
                # line 3
                source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh
                # (shift+colon) x (enter) and (ctrl+shift+n) to open a new terminal
            </pre></code>
            <p> And there you go! You should have a working installation of
                the <a href='http://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/'>
                    virtualenvwrapper</a>
                such that you are ready to use virtual
                environments when making your first pull request on your new
                Linux system!
            </p>
            <h3>Using pip virtualenvs to work on github projects</h3>
            <p> Let's make a pull request for MDAnalysis using the tools we've
                learned! </p>
            <pre><code>
                # I like to have a github/ folder for my various repositories
                # First, let's clone into the repo
                cd (press enter) # takes us to home user directory
                mkdir github
                cd github
            </pre></code>
            <p> Before moving further, you should create a github account if you
                haven't already and fork <a href='https://github.com/MDAnalysis/mdanalysis/'>
                MDAnalysis</a>. This will create a clone of the repo that will
                function as your 'origin' repository. <a href='https://github.com/MDAnalysis/mdanalysis/'>
                MDAnalysis</a> will be the 'upstream' repository that we set up
                later.
            </p>
            <pre><code>
                git clone https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/mdanalysis
                # this takes a little bit (289 megabytes)
                mkvirtualenv MDA
                workon MDA
                pip install numpy cython seaborn # installs dependencies
                pip install -e . # installs MDAnalysis such that changing files
                # changes how packages behave when loaded for a script
            </pre></code>

            <pre><code>
                git remote add upstream http://github.com/MDAnalysis/mdanalysis
                git branch NEW_PULL_REQUEST
                git fetch upstream #checks for updates
                git checkout upstream/develop -B develop # creates develop
                # branch to rebase against later and switches to it
                # there might be a way to do this without checking the branch out
                # but I dont know
                git checkout NEW_PULL_REQUEST # do work here
            </pre></code>
            <p> Any time you want to save the work you've done, you can see the
                files you've changed with
            <pre><code>
                git status
            </code></pre>
            <p> Then add them to be staged for a commit that will be merged into
                the upstream develop branch if the pull request is accepted.
            <pre><code>
                git add file_name_here
                # once you've added everything you want to include in a PR
                git commit -m 'Insert a descriptive commit message here'
            </code></pre>
            <p> If you want to make a tiny commit, and blend it into a previous commit.
            <pre><code>
                git rebase -i HEAD~(# of commits back you want to go)
            </code></pre>
            <p> Use vim style interactiveness to rebase commits. Changing 'pick'
                to 'fixup' 'squashes' a commit into the previous the first pick
                commit above it without using the commit statement.
                Using squash will combine commit statments. When happy, (shift+colon)
                (ctrl+x) and pressing Y and enter will combine commits.
                If still unsatisfied you can amend the commit manually.
            </p>
            <pre><code>
                git commit --amend #edit the commit
            </code></pre>
            <p> When you're ready to save your work to the origin directory.
            <pre><code>
                git fetch upstream
                git checkout develop
                # if prompted:
                git pull # updates changes made
                # if your command prompt makes a recursive merge, you've done
                # something wrong
                git checkout NEW_PULL_REQUEST
                git rebase develop # rebase against develop to avoid merge conflicts
                git push origin NEW_PULL_REQUEST
            </code></pre>
            <p> Before actually making a pull requestion on github, make sure
                you didn't break any tests, and you've written new tests for
                the new code you've written.
            <pre><code>
                cd ~/github/mdanalysis/testsuite/
                pip install -e .
                cd MDAnalysisTests/
                ./mda_nosetests (press enter)
            </pre></code>
                <p> Hopefully that helps! There is a bevy of more rigorous work
                that's been done on understand git branching.

            <h2> Tip 3: Get good at googling </h2>
            <p> <img src='images/noidea.jpg'>This tip from <a href='www.freecodecamp.com'>freeCodeCamp</a>
                is applicable to any problem. <a href='https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/wiki/blob/master/FreeCodeCamp-Get-Help.md'>
                Read-search-ask</a> is a strategy that will help you learn
                indepently and boost confidence. Adding on to this advice, I have
                found that if you find the email of someone knowledgable in the area
                you are struggling in, simply by writing an email explaining your problem
                you can often find the solution on your own. If you don't
                figure it out, then you might just impress that person with
                your detailed investigation. Even if they aren't impressed, they'll likely help
                you out. People in open source are generally receptive
                to people who demonstrate that they are working hard at becoming self-reliant.
                Always err on the side of not sending that email though; nobody
                likes being harassed with trivial questions.

            <h2> Tip 4: When working, avoid distractions, double check,
                triple check, quadruple check... </h2>
                <p> When working on projects involving non-commercial software
                    it is especially important to think of all the possible ways you could
                    have screwed something up. Check your code for glaring logic
                    errors and before running an intensive calculation, run a baseline
                    to ensure that things work. In quantum chemistry, an example
                    for this would be running a Hartree-Fock calculation with the STO-3G basis set
                    before doing something that scales much slower.
                    Develop scripts to ensure you are getting expected results,
                    become skilled at using grep and simple regex. (<a href='http://regexr.com/'>Regexr</a>
                    is a great playground to learn regex)
                    Assume that you've written bad code and that bugs will
                    be caused by small changes to input parameters. Expect
                    things to break easily. Inspect all work exhaustively.

                <p> When reading academic papers, print them out and read them away from a PC.
                    Usually academic papers use wildly esoteric jargon. <a href='http://ferguson.matse.illinois.edu/resources/5.pdf'>
                    This paper</a> on diffusion maps (the subject of my next blog post)
                    actually features a 'jargon box' which is just *great*. Academic
                    papers usually also assume a high level of familiarity in the
                    subject material and are written for those who are skilled at
                    reading papers. It is easier to dedicate the intense
                    concentration required for most papers when unplugging from tech
                    and using some ear plugs.

                <p> Finally, when communicating over email you can embrace
                    one of two strategies. Either you can add a 'sent from my iPhone'
                    tag to everything, or before adding recipients,
                    take a second to go get a drink of water come back and
                    reread the message for errors. Unfortunately, people will
                    judge you for poor grammar even if they don't mean to. (Shoot,
                    I just ended a sentence in a preposition...)

            <h2> Tip 5: Tackle what intimidates you </h2>
                <p> I seriously believe that this is the number one part of
                    becoming an adult and it is something I have only really
                    internalized in the last year. Problems will not go away
                    by avoiding them. Oftentimes I find myself building up things
                    in my head as if they will be a bigger deal than they actually
                    are. Figuring out how to us virtualenvs was one example of
                    such a barrier that occurred recently. This occurs in my personal
                    life as well and invariably the outcome is always better than
                    how I imagined it would be.

                    Segment your work into discrete chunks. If you
                    have a pull request you want to make, think of all the
                    possible minutia you have to work through in order to get
                    things done. I like to use Google Inbox's reminder feature
                    to constantly remind myself of these things I need to get done.
                    When I finish a task, I can swipe it off my todo list and
                    enjoy that feeling of catharsis.

        <h2 class="blog-post-title">Tempus Fugit</h2>
        <p class="blog-post-meta">May 19, 2016</p>
        <p> Bear with me, this title is not as pretentious as it might seem.
            This title is meant to have a double-meaning; not only is it a reference
            to the fact that this 'community-bonding' period is <em>FLYING</em>
            away, but also has to do with my actual <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5875821348651008">
            Summer of Code</a> project with <a href="http://www.mdanalysis.org/blog/">MDAnalysis</a>.
        </p>
        <p> The main goal of my work this summer will be to implement Principle
            Component Analysis and Diffusion Maps such that they are fast, but more
            importantly keep memory costs at a minimum. These are both <i>Dimension
            Reduction</i> techniques, and in the case of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_dynamics">
            Molecular Dynamics</a> (MD) simulation, the high-dimensional
            space being reduced is a 'trajectory' of atoms reflecting what is essentially a matrix
            in which the i<sub>th</sub> entry in a row (or column, this doesn't matter)
            reflect the xyz coordinates at the j<sub>th</sub> timestep in a simulation.
        </p>
        <p> In a MD trajectory, time flies on while the patterns of movement are left unrecorded
            in the raw data. The only limitation to the number of frames in a trajectory is access
            to computing power, this means there can be a tremendous amount of
            data to sort through. To my knowledge, the
            biggest things being studied currently are on the scale of the
            <a href='http://www.bio-itworld.com/2013/5/29/researchers-characterize-chemical-structure-hiv-capsid.html'>
            HIV-1 capsid</a>, which has 64 million atoms. Ignoring this size limitation,
            let's imagine that you're watching a tree branch swaying while you should
            be doing something far more important. Archimedes is
            quoted as saying, "Give me a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which
            to place it, and I shall move the world." Well, give me a big enough
            set of atoms and a powerful computer on which
            to run the simulation, and I can simulate that tree moving. Go ahead,
            you can quote me.
        </p>
        <p> While viewing the tree branch, your brain is processing that information. It is interpreting visual
            data that is changing with respect to time and trying to find patterns
            in that timeseries. It is, in essence, reducing the dimensionality of
            that very large data set and recording that swaying motion of the tree.
            The role of a dimension reduction algorithm on the aforementioned
            simulation is to find a similar pattern as best it can. This same idea can be used
            for facial recognition (which leads to the <em>awesome</em> term,
            <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenface'>Eigenfaces</a>)
            and many other problems. I'm a little worried that I'm being too much
            of an armchair scientist in saying this, but from what I can tell,
            the human brain is the best
            <a href='http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/06/bad-news-computers-are-getting-better-than-we-are-at-facial-recognition/372377/'>all-purpose</a>
            dimension reducer (according to my brain).
        </p>
        <p> Hopefully those attempts at metaphor weren't entirely god-awful.
            These are the ideas I am implementing and of course I have zero
            part in coming up with them. I will be drawing from work that other
            people have done for the most part, my intellectual effort will be
            spent mostly on ensuring things run as they should and that they run quickly.
        </p>
        <p> I officially start work on Monday and over this week I have been working
            to finish my senior thesis before the start date. I have also been working
            on a small refactor of an analysis module in MDAnalysis which of course
            took longer than I expected, but it is almost over with. I try to understand
            everything I'm looking at when looking at new code, and some times it
            can be somewhat of a hindrance. I like to follow the advice of smarter
            people than me, in this instance <a href='http://jvns.ca/'>Julia Evans</a>,
            and err on the side of thorough understanding. With that being said,
            a major goal and source of stress of mine is productivity.
            Eventually I'd like to write something on what I do to encourage productivity
            in the face of a mostly self-directed work environment.

        <h2 class="blog-post-title">Introduction!</h2>
        <p class="blog-post-meta">May 11, 2016</p>

        <p>Hello world! I recently was given the amazing opportunity
            to contribute to MDAnalysis, an open source Molecular Dynamics simulation
            Analysis project through the Google Summer of Code initiative. I've
            been encouraged to maintain a blog by those giving me this opportunity
            so I'll start things off by explaining how I got this great summer job.
        </p>
        <p>To summarize it quickly, Google sponsors a program in which college
            students apply to work on projects for open source software organizations.
            I was very lucky to have my research advisor, Dr. Ashley Ringer
            McDonald, encourage me to apply. I satisfied the first application requirement
            by learning how to use git and closing an issue on the <a href="https://github.com/MDAnalysis/mdanalysis/issues">MDAnalysis Github page</a>.
            After that, I spent about 40 hours of concentrated effort over spring break
            studying dimensionality reduction and molecular dynamics in order to write a coherent
            application. By turning in a rough draft early I ensured the process was iterative; the contributors to
            MDAnalysis were very helpful with their critiques of my application.
        </p>
        <p> After turning in my final application, the process didn't really stop. I made
            sure to keep making pull requests and to learn more about development workflow. I have
            learned <strong>so</strong> much about workflow and how to get over
            the dread of starting a pull request in the past few months.
        </p>
        <p> And then I got the news! I had been accepted to the Google Summer of Code!
            I was and still am extremely excited. With that being said, success
            made me lazy and somewhat complacent. Recently, I have been doing the
            bare minimum in terms of work and that is about to change. Even if
            no one is reading this, consider this blog as the first step in accountability
            for the rest of the summer. I will be using this to keep a record of everything I
            am working on day to day.
        </p>
        <p> With the exception of this introduction post, every post will attempt to
            keep a focus on a particular issue. I might write a post about a
            topic related to my Summer of Code work, or something related to
            my many other interests. I endeavor to remain positive and
            thoughtful, I will work on my clear overuse of commas, and I will
            try to make my readers laugh.
        </p>
        <p> I look forward to keeping this up! JD out. </p>
