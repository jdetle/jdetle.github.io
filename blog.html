        <p class="blog-post-meta">May 11</p>

        <p>Hello world! I recently was given the amazing opportunity
            to contribute to MDAnalysis, an open source Molecular Dynamics simulation
            Analysis project through the Google Summer of Code initiative. I've
            been encouraged to maintain a blog by those giving me this opportunity
            so I'll start things off by explaining how I got this great summer job.
        </p>
        <p>To summarize it quickly, Google sponsors a program in which college
            students apply to work on projects for open source software organizations.
            I was very lucky to have my research advisor, Dr. Ashley Ringer
            McDonald, encourage me to apply. I satisfied the first application requirement
            by learning how to use git and closing an issue on the <a href="https://github.com/MDAnalysis/mdanalysis/issues">MDAnalysis Github page</a>.
            After that, I spent about 40 hours of concentrated effort over spring break
            studying dimensionality reduction and molecular dynamics in order to write a coherent
            application. By turning in a rough draft early I ensured the process was iterative; the contributors to
            MDAnalysis were very helpful with their critiques of my application.
        </p>
        <p> After turning in my final application, the process didn't really stop. I made
            sure to keep making pull requests and to learn more about development workflow. I have
            learned <strong>so</strong> much about workflow and how to get over
            the dread of starting a pull request in the past few months.
        </p>
        <p> And then I got the news! I had been accepted to the Google Summer of Code!
            I was and still am extremely excited. With that being said, success
            made me lazy and somewhat complacent. Recently, I have been doing the
            bare minimum in terms of work and that is about to change. Even if
            no one is reading this, consider this blog as the first step in accountability
            for the rest of the summer. I will be using this to keep a record of everything I
            am working on day to day.
        </p>
        <p> With the exception of this introduction post, every post will attempt to
            keep a focus on a particular issue. I might write a post about a
            topic related to my Summer of Code work, or something related to
            my many other interests. I endeavor to remain positive and
            thoughtful, I will work on my clear overuse of commas, and I will
            try to make my readers laugh.
        </p>
        <p> I look forward to keeping this up! JD out. </p>

      <p>John Detlefs is a 22 year old Math and Chemistry Double Major
          at Cal Poly SLO graduating in June 2016. He has never been much of a
          writer. Especially when it comes to writing about himself.
